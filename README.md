### About ###

[Simple Features Projection](http://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-proj-java/) is a Java library for performing projection conversions between [Simple Feature](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-java) Geometries.

### Usage ###

#### Transform ####

```java

//Geometry geometry = ...

Projection projection1 = ProjectionFactory.getProjection(
    ProjectionConstants.AUTHORITY_EPSG,
    ProjectionConstants.EPSG_WEB_MERCATOR);
Projection projection2 = ProjectionFactory.getProjection(
    ProjectionConstants.AUTHORITY_EPSG,
    ProjectionConstants.EPSG_WORLD_GEODETIC_SYSTEM);

GeometryTransform transform = GeometryTransform.create(projection1,
    projection2);

Geometry transformed = transform.transform(geometry);

```
